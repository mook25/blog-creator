# What is Bitcoin? A Complete Guide for Beginners

**Have you heard about Bitcoin but aren't quite sure what it actually is?** You might be wondering, "I know it's digital money, but how is it different from regular money?" Today, we'll walk you through everything from Bitcoin's core concepts to safe storage methods, explained in terms anyone can understand.

## What is Bitcoin? A New Currency for the Digital Age

**Key Summary:** Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009—a digital currency that enables transactions without the need for governments or banks.

Bitcoin is a revolutionary digital currency introduced in 2009 by the mysterious developer 'Satoshi Nakamoto.' Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin has no physical form and exists only as computer code.

Its most important feature is that **there's no central authority**. While the Korean won is issued by the Bank of Korea and the US dollar by the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin is managed collectively by a worldwide network of computers.

## What are the Key Differences Between Regular Money and Bitcoin?

**Key Summary:** While central banks can control the supply of regular currencies, Bitcoin has a predetermined limit of 21 million coins total.

**Differences in Issuance**
Central banks can issue additional regular currency as needed. In contrast, Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, ensuring scarcity.

**Transaction Approval Methods**
When you send money through a bank account, the bank verifies and approves the transaction. Bitcoin transactions are approved through a **mining** process where thousands of computers worldwide verify transactions.

**Transaction Time and Fees**
International wire transfers through banks typically take 1-3 days, but Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world within an average of 10 minutes.

## How Does Bitcoin Enable Safe Transactions?

**Key Summary:** Bitcoin uses blockchain technology—a distributed ledger system that records all transactions transparently and securely.

The core technology behind Bitcoin is the **blockchain**. Simply put, it's a system where a massive ledger containing all transaction records is stored identically on computers worldwide.

**How Blockchain Works**
1. A wants to send Bitcoin to B
2. This transaction information is broadcast to the network
3. Miners worldwide verify the transaction's validity
4. Once verified, the transaction is recorded in a block
5. The new block is linked to the existing chain

Once recorded, transactions are nearly impossible to change or delete because identical records are stored on thousands of computers worldwide.

## How to Store Bitcoin Safely?

**Key Summary:** Bitcoin is most secure when stored in a cold wallet—an offline storage device.

Bitcoin storage methods fall into two main categories:

**Hot Wallets vs Cold Wallets**
- Hot Wallets: Connected to the internet (exchanges, mobile apps)
- Cold Wallets: Completely offline hardware devices

There have been numerous cases where major exchanges were hacked, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin being stolen. However, there are virtually no cases of Bitcoin stored in personal cold wallets being hacked.

**Advantages of DCENT Cold Wallets**
DCENT cold wallets store private keys in an environment completely isolated from the internet. They only connect briefly during transactions, making it impossible for hackers to access your secure storage.
